# RoboticArm

RoboticArm is a project developed to control and simulate a robotic arm using ROS2. It is designed to integrate several hardware and software components, allowing the manipulation and control of the movement of a robotic arm, with a focus on simulation and integration with sensors, actuators, and other biomedical devices.

## Features

- Robotic arm movement control and simulation
- Integration with ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Support for sensors, actuators, and biomedical device integration
- Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (main programming language)
- ROS2 installed on your system
- Any additional hardware requirements (robotic arm, sensors, actuators, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Martins-Lucaas/RoboticArm.git
    cd RoboticArm
    ```
2. Install dependencies (if any, specify in requirements.txt or package.xml).

### Usage

- Run your ROS2 environment.
- Launch the simulation or control scripts provided in the repository.
- Follow code or documentation for integrating additional sensors or devices.
